## Performance of Artificial Intelligence Applications on Embedded Parallel Platforms using Python
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Artificial Intelligence applications are mostly built and run on heterogeneous computing systems. The language tools used to develop these applications are C, C++, Java and more recently Python. The efficiency of these Artificial Intelligence Applications on heterogeneous computing systems using language tools such as C, C++, etc. have been well researched into but very little work has been done on using Python as the language tool. The purpose of this project is to study the performance of Artificial Intelligence Applications on parallel platforms using Python as the language tool and find efficient methods to improve the same.
